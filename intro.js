YOUR TURN.
ðŸ˜º Write a value for the variable defined on line 28. It's commented out so that it won't cause an error.
Once you have written the value, remove the comment characters, save this file, and reload the page in the browser.

ASSIGN A NEW VALUE TO A PREVIOUSLY DEFINED VARIABLE

Below, a new value is assigned to the firstName variable that we defined on line 17 above.
Read the code. What do you expect that the `firstName` variable will evaluate to after reassignment?

ðŸ˜º Uncomment lines 41 and 42, save this file, reload the browser page, and check the output in the console:

CREATE A NEW VARIABLE USING THE VALUE FROM ANOTHER VARIABLE

What is happening here? Use console.log() to check if you're right.

ðŸ˜º Uncomment the following lines:

ðŸ˜º Create a variable named `greeting`.
