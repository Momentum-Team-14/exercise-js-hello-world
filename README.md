# Hello, World!

## JS Edition

The intro.js file contains examples of JavaScript **expressions** that you can output to the console using `console.log`.

### Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in the browser (you can do this at the command line: run `open index.html` in this project directory).
2. In the browser where your page is open, open the dev tools, and click on the console tab.
3. In VS Code, open `intro.js` and work on the exercises in there.
   - Read the comments for further instructions.
   - Make sure to go in order. Later lines of code won't work if you haven't followed the instructions that came before.
   - Look for the smiley cat ðŸ˜º for the tasks you need to do.
   - Uncomment or replace lines that start with `//` as you work your way through each exercise.
   - Make sure to save the file and reload the browser page to run the code each time you make a change and want to see what happens.

### How comments in JavaScript work

_Comments_ in code are meant for humans to read, not for the computer. To me more specific, it's the JavaScript interpreter that runs each line of JavaScript code.

`//` at the start of the line means the interpreter will not run that line
`/*` at the start of a line begins a multiline comment
`*/` ends a multiline comment

Whatever is included between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by the interpreter.

You can add or remove the characters for comments in order to run or ignore specific lines of code.

When comment characters are added to a line of code, we say that the line is "commented out" -- that means it will not run.
